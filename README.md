# Twitter_OpenAI
Python script that uses the (old) Twitter API to read tweets from an account and then uses the OpenAI (Chat GTP) API to classify the tweets.

In this specific script, it determines if tweets from the specific account contains sales promotions in the forms of “deals”

This was a simple script to showcase my ability to use different API’s.
